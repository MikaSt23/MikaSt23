### Hi there 👋

**MikaSt23/MikaSt23** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my major for Computer Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to Program with Java and Security.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an artist. I love drawing and sometimes doing small animations.
